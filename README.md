-What is random string in the context of DNA strings?
The probability of having the specific nucleotide base for each position remains same while each nucleotide base has its own fixed probability of being picked along the DNA string. 

-What is the GC-content?
GC-context (Let say, GC_x where 0<GC_x<1) is the ratio of having G and C throughout the full DNA string. It means GC_x/2 is the ratio of being chosen for G or C, individually. By keeping in mind that the total probability should equal to 1, [1-(GC_x)]/2 is the ratio for A or T to be picked, separately.

This program specializes on finding out the common logarithm of the probability that a random string is constructed with the GC-content found in the given DNA string. So, the variety of GC-contents are given with a DNA string, the aim is to come up with common logarithm for each given GC-content individually when the DNA string remains same.
